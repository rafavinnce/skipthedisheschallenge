# Skip The Dishes Challenge

Project: rafael-skip-challenge
==============================

- This app was written in Java 8, Spring Boot and Maven.

- I use ( @RequestMapping(value = "/{productId}" Optional<...> myObject ) in OrderController just to show Spring

- I used Sublime Text IDE.

- Mysql for database. Data is located in Digitalocean cloud service.

- 404 for errors in result data.

- Tom cat is my simple server for this challenge(I'm not use another databases because for this test not applocable)

- Query classes into folder called 'repository' make this queries repository.

- JdbcTemplate core for framework data classes.

- SpringBoot Application scans model. service and repository components in same file

- I used liquibase for approach database changes . I have created a repository for all of this work. I have added one more dependency in my codebase.

- When you run the application, you should see liquibase in action, performing the changes on the 'vanhack' database.

- I started swagger api to makes documentation API.(not finish :) - Under development )

Thanks 4 ALL!
